# Restaurant Reservation and Order System

## Overview

The **Restaurant Reservation and Order System** is a comprehensive solution designed to manage restaurant operations such as table reservations, customer orders, menu management, and customer profiles. The system leverages a MySQL database to store key data and supports both customers and restaurant staff in improving efficiency and customer experience.

## Features

- **Customer Features:**
  - Account creation and login
  - Make, modify, and cancel table reservations
  - View available tables and menu items in real-time
  - Place and customize orders
  - Update profile information (e.g., email, username)
  
- **Staff Features:**
  - Manage reservations, assigning customers to available tables
  - Track table statuses (e.g., available, reserved, in service)
  - Process customer orders, update order details
  - Generate reports on menu performance and peak reservation times
  
- **Owner Features:**
  - Manage user roles and access
  - Update menu items and pricing
  - View comprehensive reports on restaurant performance
  
## Technologies

- **Database Management:** MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP or Python
- **Database Connectivity:** MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver for Java)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following software installed:

1. **MySQL** (or PostgreSQL) Database Server
2. **XAMPP** (or similar tool for running PHP) for local development
3. **IDE** (such as VS Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA) for code editing
4. **MySQL Connector/J** library for database connectivity (for Java-based projects)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Set up the Database

1. Open your MySQL Workbench (or equivalent) and create a new database.
2. Import the provided **SQL Schema** (found in the "Appendices" section of the report) to set up your tables and relationships.

### Step 3: Configure Database Connectivity

For **Java-based backend**:

- Download and add the **MySQL Connector/J** library (`mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar`) to your projectâ€™s classpath.
- Configure the `DatabaseConnection` class with your database URL, username, and password.

For **PHP-based backend**:

- Ensure your PHP project is connected to the MySQL database through `mysqli_connect()` or a similar method.

### Step 4: Run the Application

1. Start your local server (XAMPP, Apache, etc.).
2. Open the project in your IDE and run the application (either as a PHP or Java web application).

### Step 5: Test the Features

- **For customers:** Test the ability to make reservations, place orders, and modify personal details.
- **For staff:** Test the reservation management system, updating table statuses, and processing orders.
- **For owners:** Test the menu and pricing updates, as well as report generation features.

## Database Schema

This project uses the following schema:

- **Tables**
  - TableID (Primary Key)
  - Capacity
  - Status (Available, Reserved, In Service)
  
- **Customers**
  - CustomerID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Contact Info
  - Username
  - Password
  
- **Reservations**
  - ReservationID (Primary Key)
  - CustomerID (Foreign Key)
  - TableID (Foreign Key)
  - ReservationTime
  
- **Orders**
  - OrderID (Primary Key)
  - CustomerID (Foreign Key)
  - TableID (Foreign Key)
  - OrderTime
  
- **MenuItems**
  - ItemID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Price
  - Category
  
- **OrderDetails**
  - OrderID (Foreign Key)
  - ItemID (Foreign Key)
  - Quantity

## Test Cases

- **Reservations:** Test adding, updating, and deleting reservations, ensuring table status updates correctly.
- **User Profiles:** Test updates to customer profiles and validate proper storage in the database.
- **Orders:** Test placing, modifying, and deleting orders, ensuring changes are reflected in the system.

## Error Handling

The system uses `try-catch` blocks for error handling, especially for database operations. Any errors, such as SQL exceptions, are logged for debugging purposes.

## Known Issues

- Limited frontend design, which can be enhanced for better user experience.
- No cross-platform support for mobile devices yet.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the frontend design and interface for better aesthetics.
- Add cross-platform support (tablet and mobile).
- Integrate third-party services (e.g., delivery systems, loyalty programs).
