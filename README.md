### Restaurant Reservation and Order System Setup Guide

## Overview

The **Restaurant Reservation and Order System** is an integrated solution designed to manage restaurant operations such as table reservations, customer orders, and menu management. The system uses a **MySQL** database, which interacts with a **Java** backend using **MySQL Connector/J** for database connectivity. The front end is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and the server is deployed using **Apache Tomcat**. The application also utilizes **Eclipse IDE** for development and managing the project lifecycle.

### Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realdarter/Restaurant-DataBase
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up the MySQL Database**

1. **Open MySQL Workbench:**
   - If you don't already have MySQL Workbench, install it from [MySQL's official site](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

2. **Create a New Database:**
   - Open MySQL Workbench and log into your MySQL server.
   - Create a new database for the restaurant system:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE restaurant_system;
     ```

3. **Create Tables with Java Class:**
   - Instead of using raw SQL scripts to create the database schema, we'll run the `dbcreate_schema.java` file within Eclipse.
   - This approach ensures that the schema is created properly, deletes existing tables if they exist, and re-creates them from scratch.

#### **Step 3: Configure the Project and Dependencies**

1. **Add Dependencies to Eclipse:**
   - **MySQL Connector/J:** Download the MySQL JDBC driver from [MySQL Connector/J Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/), then add the JAR to the project in Eclipse:
     - Right-click the project > **Build Path** > **Add External Archives...** > Select the downloaded `mysql-connector-java-x.x.x.jar`.
   
   - **Tomcat JDBC Driver (Jakarta):** Download the Tomcat JDBC driver from [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi). Then add this JAR to your project using the same method as above.

#### **Step 4: Set Up Tomcat in Eclipse**

1. **Install Apache Tomcat:**
   - If you donâ€™t have Tomcat, download and unzip it from the [Apache Tomcat download page](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi).

2. **Link Tomcat to Eclipse:**
   - Go to **Window > Preferences**.
   - Navigate to **Server > Runtime Environments**, then click **Add External Servers** and choose the Tomcat installation directory.
   
3. **Create a New Server in Eclipse:**
   - Open the **Servers** tab in Eclipse, right-click and select **New > Server**.
   - Choose **Apache Tomcat v9.x** and set the Tomcat installation path.
   - Add your project to the server by selecting your project and clicking **Add**.


### Step 5: Configure Database Connection in Code

Before running the project, you need to ensure that your Java code can connect to the MySQL database properly. This is done in the **DatabaseConnection class**.

#### **Steps to Configure the Database Connection:**

1. **Create/Modify the `DatabaseConnection.java` Class:**
   - This class is responsible for establishing a connection between your Java backend and MySQL database using JDBC.
   
   Example code for **DatabaseConnection.java**:

   ```java
   package restaurant;

   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.DriverManager;
   import java.sql.SQLException;

   public class DatabaseConnection {
       // Database credentials and URL
       private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/restaurant_system"; // Replace with your DB name
       private static final String USER = "root"; // Replace with your MySQL username
       private static final String PASSWORD = "student"; // Replace with your MySQL password

       // Method to get the database connection
       public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
           try {
               // Load the MySQL JDBC driver
               Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
               // Establish and return the connection
               return DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASSWORD);
           } catch (ClassNotFoundException | SQLException e) {
               // Handle exceptions and print a message
               throw new SQLException("Connection failed.", e);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Explanation:**
   - **DB_URL:** This is the URL of your MySQL server along with the database name. For example, `"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/restaurant_system"`. Replace `restaurant_system` with the actual name of your database.
   - **USER and PASSWORD:** These are your MySQL credentials. In the example, the username is `"root"` and the password is `"student"`. Update these to match your MySQL server credentials.
   - The `getConnection()` method loads the MySQL JDBC driver and uses `DriverManager.getConnection()` to establish a connection to the database.

3. **Using the `DatabaseConnection` Class:**
   - Anywhere in your Java application where you need a connection to the database, you can call:
     ```java
     Connection conn = DatabaseConnection.getConnection();
     ```
   - This will provide a live connection to the MySQL database that you can use for executing SQL queries.

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Ensure the MySQL JDBC Driver is added** to your project as mentioned in Step 3 (adding `mysql-connector-java-x.x.x.jar` to your project's build path).
- **Match the MySQL database URL, username, and password** in this file with your actual MySQL setup.

Once this class is correctly set up and the MySQL JDBC driver is included, your application should be able to connect to the database without any issues.

#### **Step 6: Run Schema Creation**

1. **Run `dbcreate_schema.java`:**
   - In the `src/main/java/restaurant/dbcreate_schema.java` file, this class is responsible for creating the required tables in the MySQL database. Running this Java class will ensure the proper setup of the schema.

   - **Why run this Java class?**
     - It not only creates the tables if they don't exist but also removes any previously created tables before rebuilding them.
     - This ensures that the schema is always fresh and matches the latest structure.

#### **Step 7: Initialize Data**

1. **Run `initialize_data.java`:**
   - After running `dbcreate_schema.java`, run the `initialize_data.java` class to populate the tables with sample data. This class adds 15+ items into each table (e.g., 15 customers, 15 menu items) to make the system operational for testing.
   

   - **Why use `initialize_data.java`?**
     - It's a more efficient approach for initializing the database than manually running SQL scripts.
     - It ensures the data is populated in a consistent manner across all tables with a batch insertion process.
   
   - After running this Java class, the database will have 15+ entries for each table, ready for testing.

#### **Step 8: Deploy and Run the Application**

1. **Start Tomcat in Eclipse:**
   - Open the **Servers** tab, right-click your Tomcat server, and select **Start**.

2. **Deploy the Web Application:**
   - Right-click the project > **Run As** > **Run on Server**.
   - The application should now be available at `http://localhost:8080/your-project-name` in your browser.

#### **Step 9: Test the Features**

- **Customer Testing:** Test creating accounts, making reservations, placing orders, and managing profiles.
- **Staff Testing:** Test reservation management, table status updates, and order processing.
- **Owner Testing:** Test menu updates, report generation, and user role management.

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

- **Limited Frontend Design:** The user interface could be further enhanced for better responsiveness and aesthetics.
- **Mobile Support:** The system currently lacks optimized views for mobile devices.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Implement support for mobile/tablet devices in the future.

By following this setup guide, you should have a fully functional restaurant reservation and order system running in Eclipse with MySQL, Tomcat, and all necessary database setup.
